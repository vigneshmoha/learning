# Learnings
One of the most important skill for a programmer is to keep their brain active. A problem can be solved in many different ways. Best solution might not be a best solution tomorrow or in the future. It evolves and often people comes up with something new. Intention of this repository is to learn and implement different things/tutorials from the internet. It can be called as a notes of my learning journey.

### Algorithms
This section of my notes contains redo of an algorithm which was already solved to understand why it was solved in a particular way.

### Apps
Simple application programs in different languages to brush up or learn a programming language.
