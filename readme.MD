# Learnings
Intention of this repository is to learn and implement different things/tutorials from the internet. It can be called as a notes of my learning journey. 

### Algorithms
One of the most important skill for a programmer to keep their brain active. A problem can be solved in many different ways. Best solution might not be a best solution tomorrow or in the future since it evolves often and people come up something new, ALWAYS. This topic notes is to redo an algorithm which was already solved to understand why it was solved in a particular way.
